Modified version of the li3_sqlsrv library from (https://github.com/jperras/li3_sqlsrv),
which allows for transparent usage of the mssql driver where the sqlsrv driver is not available.

Currently, the sqlsrv driver provided by Microsoft is Windows only.  mssql works on both but does not fully support
the most recent version of SQL Server.  Ideally, I'll add a further failover step using ODBTP or ODBC at some point.
